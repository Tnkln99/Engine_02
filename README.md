# Engine_02

I created this realtime rendering engine using C++ and Opengl graphics api.
Important techniques/features I used in this project are multiple light-assisted shadow mapping, phong shading, a dynamic example of component-based architecture (like Unity), skybox creation and model loading (with or without textures).
